## Xin chào, and welcome to my GitHub channel 👋

😁 I'm Chi (it is pronounced like Cheese without the "se", not like Chi Square)
🧐 I'm interested to utilizing data in the business world without forgetting and dehumanizing the audiences that such data represents
📈 I'm currently learning Excel, Python, SQL, Power BI, Tableau and Stata
👩‍💼 I have had experiences in Digital Marketing (Search Engine Optimization and Web Analytics), Customer Success, Digital Transformation, Sales, and Business Operations
🎓 I'm looking to become a Business Analyst, Marketing Analyst, Sales & Business Development Analyst, Product Manager, or Management Consultant
